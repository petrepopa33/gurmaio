# Gurmaio: Cloud-Native Meal Planning Platform

A production-ready, cloud-native meal planning application that generates budget-aware, nutrition-accurate meal plans with explicit cost calculation at all levels.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Transparent** - Every cost and nutritional value is calculated deterministically and displayed clearly to build user trust, with explicit disclaimers about estimates
2. **Precise** - Budget calculations account for real-world shopping constraints (minimum quantities, unit conversions, rounding)
3. **Efficient** - Edge-first architecture delivers sub-200ms response times globally with stateless, horizontally scalable design
4. **Store-Ready** - Compliant with App Store and Google Play requirements including privacy policies, data deletion, and clear AI usage disclosure

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, likely with multiple views)
This is a commercial-grade product requiring multiple sophisticated engines (nutrition aggregation, cost calculation, shopping list generation), external service integrations (AI for meal composition, Supabase for persistence), strict separation of concerns (thin client, deterministic backend), and compliance with app store requirements and GDPR regulations.

## Essential Features

### User Profile & Onboarding
- **Functionality**: Capture budget, meal plan duration, dietary preferences, restrictions, personal metrics for automatic calorie calculation, and macro distribution targets
- **Purpose**: Establish constraints for AI generation, enable personalized meal planning, calculate scientifically-accurate calorie targets, and define specific macronutrient goals (e.g., high protein for muscle gain)
- **Trigger**: First app launch or profile editing
- **Progression**: Welcome screen → Budget input → Duration selection → Nutrition goals (weight, height, age, sex, activity level, objective) → Auto-calculated calorie target display → Macro targets selection (Balanced, High Protein, Low Carb, Keto, Endurance, or Custom) → Dietary preferences → Allergen selection → Cuisine preferences → Save profile
- **Success criteria**: Profile saved with all metrics, calorie target calculated using Mifflin-St Jeor equation, macro percentages validated to sum to 100%, validation prevents invalid inputs, preferences correctly constrain meal generation, users can toggle between automatic and manual calorie entry, users can select preset macro splits or define custom percentages

### Meal Plan Generation
- **Functionality**: Generate a multi-day meal plan with per-meal nutrition, per-meal cost, daily totals, full plan totals, and adherence to specific macro percentage targets
- **Purpose**: Provide users with a complete, budget-compliant eating schedule that meets their specific macronutrient goals (e.g., 40% protein for muscle building, 5% carbs for keto)
- **Trigger**: User taps "Generate Plan" or completes onboarding
- **Progression**: Tap generate → Loading state → AI generates composition with macro constraints → Backend calculates nutrition → Backend calculates costs → Validate macro percentages → Check budget → Display plan with full breakdown including macro distribution visualization
- **Success criteria**: Plan stays within budget (or shows explicit overage), all nutrition values sum correctly, macro percentages closely match user's targets (within 5%), costs include shopping reality (minimum quantities), visual macro distribution chart shows actual percentages achieved

### Nutrition & Cost Breakdown
- **Functionality**: Display hierarchical view of nutrition and cost (ingredient → meal → day → plan)
- **Purpose**: Build trust through transparency and enable informed decision-making
- **Trigger**: View generated meal plan
- **Progression**: Plan overview → Tap day → View meals → Tap meal → See ingredients with individual nutrition/cost
- **Success criteria**: All values are deterministic, sums are accurate, units are clear, currency is localized

### Shopping List Generation
- **Functionality**: Aggregate all ingredients across all days, normalize units, apply minimum-buy logic, calculate realistic grocery basket cost
- **Purpose**: Provide actionable shopping guidance with accurate total cost
- **Trigger**: User taps "Shopping List" from active meal plan
- **Progression**: Tap shopping list → Aggregate ingredients → Normalize units → Apply minimum quantities → Display list with estimated cost
- **Success criteria**: No duplicate ingredients, quantities are realistic (e.g., "2 onions" not "137g onion"), total cost reflects actual grocery store purchases

### Shopping List Export
- **Functionality**: Export shopping list to popular grocery delivery services (Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Walmart) or as downloadable files (CSV, Plain Text)
- **Purpose**: Enable seamless integration with users' preferred grocery shopping platforms and workflows
- **Trigger**: User taps "Export to Grocery Service" button from shopping list view
- **Progression**: Tap export → Choose service → Content copied to clipboard or file downloaded → Paste into grocery service app or open file
- **Success criteria**: Export formats are service-appropriate, clipboard copy works reliably, file downloads succeed, exported data is complete and formatted correctly

### User Authentication & Session Management
- **Functionality**: GitHub OAuth login/logout with persistent user sessions and profile display
- **Purpose**: Enable personalized data persistence across devices and secure meal plan storage
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Log in" button on welcome screen or avatar dropdown in header
- **Progression**: Click login → GitHub OAuth flow → Return to app with session → Avatar displays in header with dropdown menu (username, email, logout option)
- **Success criteria**: User session persists across page reloads, avatar displays correctly, logout clears session and redirects appropriately

### Meal Plan Saving & Persistence

## Edge Case Handling

- **Budget Impossible** - Show clear message if budget is too low for minimum viable nutrition, suggest minimum budget based on region
- **AI Generation Failure** - Retry with relaxed constraints (max 3 attempts), fallback to template-based plans
- **Ingredient Price Missing** - Fall back to category average, flag as "estimated" in UI
- **Allergen Conflict** - Validate AI output, reject plans containing user allergens, trigger regeneration
- **Network Offline** - Cache last meal plan, show cached data with offline indicator, queue mutations
- **Budget Exceeded After Generation** - Show explicit overage, offer to regenerate with stricter constraints or increase budget
- **Malformed AI Response** - Schema validation, detailed error logging, automatic retry with simplified prompt

- **Deleted Current Plan** - If user deletes the currently active meal plan from history, plan remains in current view but is removed from saved list
- **Incomplete Calorie Data** - When user hasn't filled all required fields for auto-calculation, system gracefully shows no calculated value and allows profile saving without target calories
- **Invalid Biometric Data** - Validate weight (30-300kg), height (100-250cm), age (13-120) to prevent calculation errors and nonsensical results
- **Manual vs Auto Calorie Toggle** - Preserve both manual entry and calculated values when switching modes, prevent data loss on accidental toggles
- **Language Fallback** - If a translation key is missing, fallback to English version to prevent broken UI
- **Browser Language Detection** - On first visit, detect browser language and auto-select if supported, otherwise default to English

## Calorie Calculation Algorithm

**Method**: Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (internationally recognized, clinically validated)

**Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculation**:
- Male: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- Female: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161

**Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**:
TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier

**Activity Multipliers**:
- Sedentary (little or no exercise): 1.2
- Light (exercise 1-3 days/week): 1.375
- Moderate (exercise 3-5 days/week): 1.55
- Active (exercise 6-7 days/week): 1.725
- Very Active (intense exercise daily): 1.9

**Objective Adjustments**:
- Lose Weight: TDEE - 500 cal/day (safe 0.5kg/week loss)
- Maintain Weight: TDEE (no adjustment)
- Gain Muscle: TDEE + 300 cal/day (lean bulk)

**Final Target Calories** = TDEE + Objective Adjustment (rounded to nearest whole number)

## Design Direction

The design should evoke precision, trust, and clarity - like a financial dashboard meets nutrition science. Users must feel confident that every number is accurate and every recommendation is within their means. The aesthetic should be modern, data-forward, and approachable (not clinical).

## Color Selection

**Primary Color**: Deep Forest Green (oklch(0.45 0.12 155)) - Communicates fresh ingredients, health, and growth. Used for primary actions, navigation, and key metrics.

**Secondary Colors**: 
- Warm Cream (oklch(0.96 0.01 85)) - Soft background for cards and sections, creates warmth without harshness
- Slate Gray (oklch(0.35 0.01 255)) - Supporting text, borders, and inactive states

**Accent Color**: Vibrant Citrus (oklch(0.72 0.18 85)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for budget alerts, CTAs, and cost breakdowns. Energetic without being alarming.

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary (Deep Forest Green oklch(0.45 0.12 155)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
- Accent (Vibrant Citrus oklch(0.72 0.18 85)): Dark Slate text (oklch(0.25 0.01 255)) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
- Background (Warm Cream oklch(0.96 0.01 85)): Dark Slate text (oklch(0.25 0.01 255)) - Ratio 12.4:1 ✓
- Muted (Light Gray oklch(0.92 0.005 255)): Medium Slate text (oklch(0.45 0.01 255)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and approachability - clear data display with human warmth.

- **Primary**: Space Grotesk (headings, key numbers) - Technical precision with personality, excellent for displaying costs and nutrition values
- **Secondary**: Inter (body text, UI labels) - Highly legible, excellent for data-dense interfaces, works well at small sizes

**Typographic Hierarchy**:
- H1 (App Title): Space Grotesk Bold / 32px / tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
- H2 (Section Headers): Space Grotesk SemiBold / 24px / normal letter-spacing
- H3 (Card Titles): Space Grotesk Medium / 18px / normal letter-spacing
- Body (Content): Inter Regular / 16px / line-height 1.6
- Small (Meta Info): Inter Regular / 14px / line-height 1.5
- Data (Numbers): Space Grotesk Medium / 16-20px / tabular-nums

## Animations

Animations should reinforce the sense of precision and calculation. Use purposeful, snappy transitions that communicate "computing" and "calculating" rather than arbitrary decoration. Key moments:
- Budget validation: Smooth progress bar with easing that suggests calculation
- Meal plan generation: Staggered reveal of cards (top to bottom) with slide-up + fade
- Cost updates: Number animations (counting up/down) for budget changes
- Navigation: Slide transitions with slight parallax for depth
- Success states: Gentle spring animation on checkmarks and success indicators
